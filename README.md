# Distributed Systems Simulator

## Submission information

The final version of our code is in this GitHub repository. Earlier in the project, we coded in this DeepNote (which is like Google Docs but for Jupyter Notebooks): [DeepNote Link](https://deepnote.com/project/Map-Reduce-Simulator-JscpkNT9T1Gi0bT7cSeETw/%2F260r-map-reduce-deepnote%2FCS260_R_Simulator.ipynb). Then, we moved our code from the DeepNote into this GitHub repository to form the current file structure (as described in the presentation), so our GitHub commit history is also not representative of our actual coding history since it doesn't include our DeepNote code history.   

Here is the link to our Google Slides used in the presentation: [Google Slides Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Bq2si8Vm5lxPr3p8aw76BVAAUfi6X4yry7EiHawj9VU/edit?usp=sharing)
